A Turtle compiler.  The turtle language is described at 
http://cs.anu.edu.au/students/comp3610.2009/assignments/Assignment2-Turtle.pdf


Usage: turtle [options] [file]...
Options:
  -o FILE  --output=FILE  output FILE
  -m MODE  --mode=MODE    mode={parse|desugar|disasm|binary}


Turtle can read from and write to files, or to stdin and stdout.  If
no file is specified on the command-line, stdin is assumed for input.
If the -o option is omitted, stdout is assumed for output.


Turtle can produce output from various stages of the compilation
process.  The following compilation modes are supported:
  parse:   The input is only parsed for grammatic correctness
  deusgar: The input is parsed, and transformed into PDPlot's core
  	   language
  disasm:  The input is compiled, but the result is outputted in
  	   an assesmbly code like format
  binary:  The compiled input is outputted in as ASCII 16-bit words

If no mode is specified, binary mode is assumed.


Example usage:
	bin/./turtle -o test0.p tests/test0.t
	cat tests/test0.t | bin/./turtle
	bin/./turtle -m disasm tests/test0.t

Notable variations from the language specification include:
  * inclusion of an arithmetic division operator /
  * inclusion of usual comparison operators (>, >=, <=, !=) 
  * functions can be called before they are declared, without the need
  for pre-declarations. 
  * whitespace is completely arbitrary - newlines are interpretted in
  the same way as spaces
  * allow builtin drawing functions up and down to have trailing empty
  parens 


Example files to demonstrate implementation of new functionality:
	bin/./turtle mytests/divoperator.t -m desugar
	bin/./turtle mytests/comparators.t -m desugar

Example runs to demonstrate handling of syntatic errors:
	$ bin/turtle mytests/garbage.t
	turtle: lexical error

	$ bin/turtle mytests/trivial-syntax-error.t
	turtle: Parse error at line 2, column 8

	$ bin/turtle mytests/vardec-in-body.t
	turtle: Parse error at line 4, column 3

	$ bin/turtle mytests/no-cket.t
	turtle: Parse error at end of file, still expecting more tokens.

Example runs to demonstrate handling of semantic errors:
	$ bin/turtle mytests/global-var-redec.t 
	turtle: Global variable "x" declared more than once.

	$ bin/turtle mytests/local-param-clash.t
	turtle: Local variable "e" is already declared as a parameter in this function.a

	$ bin/turtle mytests/param-redec.t
	turtle: Parameter "c" is already declared in this function.

	$ bin/turtle mytests/local-var-redec.t
	turtle: Local variable "e" is already declared in this function.

	$ bin/turtle mytests/wrong-param-count.t
	turtle: Function "Oops" expects 2 parameters but was called with 1 parameters.

	$ bin/turtle mytests/undeclared-fun.t
	turtle: Undeclared function "oops" called.
